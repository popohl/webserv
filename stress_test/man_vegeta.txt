Stress TEST on port 9000 with GET request

echo "GET http://localhost:9000/" | ./stress_test/vegeta attack -duration=30s | tee results.bin | ./stress_test/vegeta report

Attack with a Target list (multiple URL)
./stress_test/vegeta attack -duration=20s -targets=stress_test/target.list | tee results.bin | ./stress_test/vegeta report

-rate define the number of attack per second (default = 50/1s)

./stress_test/vegeta plot -title=Result_of_the_attack results.bin > results.html

Requests shows the total number of requests sent during the test and the rate of the requests
Duration shows the total duration of the test, the attack period simulating load on the application and the wait time
Latencies shows the mean latency, 50th, 95th an 99th percentiles, respectively, of the latencies of all requests in an attack as well as the maximum latency recognized.
Bytes In and Bytes Out shows:
The total number of bytes sent (out) or received (in) with the request or response bodies.
The mean number of bytes sent (out) or received (in) with the request or response bodies.
Success shows the percentiles of successful requests sent to the application
Status Codes provides a counter of the HTTP response codes received and their occurrence. A 0 status codes mean a request failed to be sent.
